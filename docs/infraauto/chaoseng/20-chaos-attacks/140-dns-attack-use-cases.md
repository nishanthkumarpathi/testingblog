# DNS Attack Use Cases

**Technical Use Cases**

**Prepare for DNS Provider Outages**

Despite being a critical part of modern networks, DNS failures often catch teams unprepared. In July 2021, an [Akamai outage](https://www.reuters.com/technology/websites-airlines-banks-tech-companies-down-widespread-outage-2021-07-22/) caused many top websites to go down across airlines, retail, finance, and other industries. Running DNS attacks lets you proactively simulate a DNS outage to test your ability to fallback to other DNS services, reroute traffic to the primary service once itâ€™s back online, and ensure that your services remain operational during the outage.

**Business Initiatives Aligned with DNS Attacks**

Reliable DNS ensures that your customers can access your websites over the network. A DNS outage can make it appear as if your website or web services are offline, even if all of your systems are operating normally. Teams can use DNS attacks to prepare for and mitigate the impact of DNS outages, improving availability and uptime.
