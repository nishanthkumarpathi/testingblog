# Secure the Dashboard With TLS



### Prerequisites

This builds on the work done in the previous lessons. If you haven't completed those yet, please do that first!

### What's Wrong With the Dashboard?

Let's talk about TLS.

The command-line options for K3s activate TLS support for the websecure entrypoint. We saw this when our Ingress automatically responded on HTTPS with the default Traefik certificate. If you install Traefik from the Traefik Labs Helm chart, TLS is not active on any entrypoint. Why might that be?

Remember that entrypoints are **protocol independent**. If you activate TLS globally on an entrypoint, then all Routers on that entrypoint have to terminate TLS. If no certificate is provided, then the default Traefik cert gets used. If you're doing TCP passthrough to a backend with its own TLS certificate, then it's better to just pass the TCP stream directly through. The only way to do this is if you don't activate TLS on the TCP router.

What _you_ do is unique to your environment. Traefik Proxy is flexible. If you know that port 443 is always going to serve HTTPS, then activate TLS on that entrypoint. If you want to have more granular control over encrypted traffic, then activate it on the individual routers.

As I alluded to earlier, the configuration that we've just created is completely insecure. We're accessing data over HTTP and sending our credentials in plaintext. If my mom saw that, she'd wag her finger at me and say, "This just _will not do_."

We want to wrap our communication in TLS encryption, and for that, we'll generate certificates with cert-manager.

### Doesn't Traefik Proxy Come With Let's Encrypt Support?

In the non-Kubernetes world, integration with Let's Encrypt within a container orchestrator is difficult. Traefik Labs solved this by building support for ACME certificate generation into Traefik Proxy. Certificates are stored in a file called `acme.json`, and if you think about how Docker works, storing this file on a persistent volume is easy.

Traefik Proxy works the same everywhere, which means that in Kubernetes the ACME support still writes out to `acme.json`, but putting this on a PersistentVolume introduces new challenges.

* Do you pin Traefik Proxy to one host by using a Local volume?
* If you want to run multiple replicas, can you mount it RWX via NFS? What if you don't have an NFS server?
* Even if you do run multiple replicas, does Traefik Proxy handle file locking, or will each replica clobber the files written by the others? (**SPOILER:** It doesn't do locking.)

These are not new problems, and the solution for Kubernetes is to store each certificate in its own Secret.

Unfortunately, _because_ Traefik Proxy works the same on every orchestrator, and because every orchestrator doesn't have a Secret resource, Traefik Proxy doesn't (yet) store certificates in Secrets. It's not the end of the world, though, because it can read certificates _from_ Secrets in both the Ingress and IngressRoute resources.

For that reason, and to make sure that you can spin up new replicas before shutting down the old ones, we recommend using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to generate certificates in Kubernetes.

> **PRO TIP:** If you're planning on deploying Rancher into the same Kubernetes cluster where Traefik Proxy is running, cert-manager is required. Since it's already in the cluster, there's no reason not to use it for all certificates everywhere.

### Set up cert-manager

If you don't have cert-manager running in your environment, it's trivial to install and configure.

(If you already have it in your cluster, skip the rest of this section.)

#### Install cert-manager

According to [the docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/), the easiest way to install cert-manager is via `kubectl apply` and pointing to [their static manifest](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.0/cert-manager.yaml) (currently 1.7.0).

Alternatively, you can use [cmctl](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/cmctl/) or [Helm](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/).

```
âž¤ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.0/cert-manager.yaml
...
namespace/cert-manager created
serviceaccount/cert-manager-cainjector created
serviceaccount/cert-manager created
serviceaccount/cert-manager-webhook created
configmap/cert-manager-webhook created
...lots of output...
```

Verify that cert-manager Pods are running before continuing.

```
âž¤ kubectl get po -n cert-manager
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-cainjector-57d549777c-2tndk   1/1     Running   0          2m41s
cert-manager-58dff77b6d-fxk64              1/1     Running   0          2m41s
cert-manager-webhook-795c6b46b-flwlm       1/1     Running   0          2m41s
```

#### Create a ClusterIssuer

A ClusterIssuer will issue certificates for any request that comes in from any namespace in the cluster. What follows is [a sample ClusterIssuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/#creating-a-basic-acme-issuer) for the Let's Encrypt staging environment.

```
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
  acme:
    # You must replace this email address with your own.
    # Let's Encrypt will use this to contact you about expiring
    # certificates, and issues related to your account.
    email: user@example.com
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret resource that will be used to store the account's private key.
      name: example-issuer-account-key
    # Add a single challenge solver, HTTP01 using nginx
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```

This uses the HTTP01 challenge type, and it will create Ingress resources that set `ingressClass: nginx` in their configuration.

An ingress class is usually only present when there are multiple ingress controllers in a cluster. In the case of a default K3s installation, Traefik Proxy doesn't set an ingress class. It is the default (and only) ingress controller.

If we used this ClusterIssuer, we would change the solver to not specify any options for the `http01` key:

```
solvers:
- http01: {}
```

This ClusterIssuer won't work for our demo environment because we're not connected to the public Internet or using routable hostnames. We could use the DNS01 resolver instead, or for the sake of this class, we can just create a ClusterIssuer for self-signed certificates.

```
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
```

Copy and save that as `clusterissuer.yaml` and apply it to your cluster:

```
âž¤ kubectl apply -f clusterissuer.yaml

clusterissuer.cert-manager.io/selfsigned created
```

### Generate a Certificate For the Dashboard

It's possible with cert-manager to have certificates generated automatically through annotations on the Ingress resource, but not only are we not using an Ingress resource, we also want to have control over the resources our cluster generates. Instead of creating them automatically, we'll declare them with a Certificate resource.

(If you already have cert-manager and an Issuer or ClusterIssuer other than the `selfsigned` one we created in the previous step, then edit the Certificate manifest below to use your own Issuer or ClusterIssuer.)

```
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: dashboard
spec:
  dnsNames:
  - 'dashboard.traefik.10.68.0.70.sslip.io'
  issuerRef:
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    name: selfsigned
  secretName: dashboard-crt
```

Copy and save that as `certificate.yaml`. Edit it to change the hostname to use your own IP address, and apply it to the cluster.

```
âž¤ sed -i "s/10\.68\.0\.70/${CLUSTERIP}/" certificate.yaml
âž¤ kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml

certificate.cert-manager.io/dashboard created

âž¤ kubectl get secret | grep tls

k3s-serving                      kubernetes.io/tls                     2      157m
dashboard-crt                    kubernetes.io/tls                     3      16s
```

When you applied that manifest, the Certificate went through the cert-manager process, and the output was stored in the Secret `dashboard-crt`.

Using cert-manager abstracts the issuing backend from the requested resource. By changing the issuer, the same Certificate could generate a certificate from HashiCorp Vault, ACME (including Let's Encrypt), Venafi, AWS, FreeIPA, [and others](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/).

### Add the Certificate to the IngressRoute

To use this certificate, we need to make two changes to our IngressRoute:

1. Change the entrypoint from `web` to `websecure`
2. Add a `tls` key that points to the Secret where our certificate is stored.

Copy and save the following patch as `patch-dashboard-tls.yaml` and apply it to your cluster.

```
- op: replace
  path: /spec/entryPoints
  value:
    - websecure
- op: add
  path: /spec/tls
  value:
    secretName: dashboard-crt
```

```
âž¤ kubectl patch ingressroute/traefik-dashboard-secure \
  --type=json \
  --patch-file patch-dashboard-tls.yaml

ingressroute.traefik.containo.us/traefik-dashboard-secure patched
```

Now if you visit the dashboard, you'll be greeted by a certificate warning, and after accepting that terrible risk, you'll be taken to the secured dashboard.

> **PRO TIP:** If you're using a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Vivaldi, Edge, etc.) and get an error that the certificate data is scrambled and you've been saved by the browser from a terrible fate, just type `thisisunsafe` over the browser window to force the page to load. ðŸ¤¯

### Add a Redirect for HTTP

This is all good, but now we don't have anything listening on HTTP. Let's create a new IngressRoute and Middleware to bounce HTTP to HTTPS.

The `redirectScheme` middleware will redirect `http://` to `https://`. We're adding `permanent: true` because we want this redirect to be permanently stored in the browser.

```
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: redirect-permanent
spec:
  redirectScheme:
    permanent: true
    scheme: https
```

Copy and save that as `middleware-scheme.yaml` and then apply it to your cluster.

```
âž¤ kubectl apply -f middleware-scheme.yaml

middleware.traefik.containo.us/redirect-permanent created
```

The IngressRoute for HTTP will listen on the `web` entrypoint and will use the `redirect-permanent` Middleware.

```
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: traefik-dashboard-http
spec:
  entryPoints:
  - web
  routes:
  - kind: Rule
    match: Host("dashboard.traefik.10.68.0.70.sslip.io")
    services:
    - name: api@internal
      kind: TraefikService
    middlewares:
    - name: redirect-permanent
```

Copy and save that as `ingressroute.yaml`. Edit the hostname to reflect your local cluster's address, and then apply it to the cluster.

```
âž¤ sed -i "s/10\.68\.0\.70/${CLUSTERIP}/" ingressroute.yaml
âž¤ kubectl apply -f ingressroute.yaml

ingressroute.traefik.containo.us/traefik-dashboard-http created
```

Now when you visit the dashboard over HTTP you'll be redirected to HTTPS:

```
âž¤ curl -si http://dashboard.traefik.$CLUSTERIP.sslip.io | head -n 1

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
```
